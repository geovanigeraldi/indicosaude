   *** AD INTEGRATION ***

   - A 468px X 60px ad can be inserted into the top header and/or place a few
     125px X 125px ads or a single 250px X 250px ad in the sidebar like so:
   - From the Admin screen, select "Manage" > "Design" > "Widgets".
   - Under "Current Widgets" choose either "TopAd" or "SideAd".
   - Under "Available Widgets" choose "Text" by clicking "Add".
   - Under "Current Widgets" click "Edit" to the right of "Text".
   - I would leave the widget UNTITLED if I were you, but you don't have to.
   - Paste your ad HTML code into the larger text editor box.
   - Click "Change" > "Save Changes".
